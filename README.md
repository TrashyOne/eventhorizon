# eventhorizon
the root tool for the meta surveillance devices (Quest 3/3s). ROOT ON BOOT

# AIO Editions: 
(Please grant eventhorizon root access after rooting for most of these to work)

- All "safe root things" tweaks + Custom color selection
- Meta Domain Blocker (no root required)
- Terminal built into the app with root access
- Wireless ADB with root access
- CPU Tweaks: Temp/Freq monitoring, set minimum freq toggle, & governor switch (schedutil and performance)
- App section with useful apps to install & a dogfood hub toggle
- Intercept system: Stops Horizon Feed & Social Connections from launching (No more seeing those apps on boot or when you wake your headset ever again!)
